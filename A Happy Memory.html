        <p>Oceanside, California, Avocado road. A beautiful view of the beach. Aesthetically pleasing house. Let’s go to the beach. A short walk. We eat fish sticks and play in the sand. After that, we play in the waves. The waves are crashing everywhere. The sun shines on you just right to make rainbows form. I find multiple seashells, I share some with you. We have a great time. A memory to last ages to come. A happy memory.

        <p>After a LONG trip with many complications and setbacks literal;y setting us back to Los Vegas to find another route because the mountain was snowed in, we made it the Oceanside, the friendly neighbour of LA. The house was nice, I’d say 9.5/10. After falling asleep in the cosy bed, before we knew it it was morning! There was a whole big new day ahead of us! What a memory.</p>
        <p>Going to the beach practically every day was a blast, the boardwalk was awesome, and there were only one or two homeless people I saw! Playing in the sand for an hour, Playing in the waves for the next hour, and both for the last hour! The occasional shops were fun to check out too! Besides the fact that a toddler was throwing oversized rocks at me, the beach was great! What a memory.
</p>
        <p>We (meaning me and my family) went to a Mexican restaurant with my mom’s cousin and his family and we found out I have three different family members I share my birthday with! I already knew I shared a birthday with my dad but that is beside the point. The food was delicious and The Grinch was playing in the background. What a memory.</p>
        <p>I also went to the mission at Oceanside. I learned a lot and I enjoyed it. It is a dazzling place that holds information about the people that were once there and is a charming build. You can learn about the missionaries that were there and you can see how it looks. I also got a cool magnet at the gift shop. What an excellent way to remember the place. What a memory.
</p>
        <p>I’d share more about my vacation but there is so much to say I can’t pack it into one essay and it would be hard to organize, so I’ll leave it at that and we’ll keep the main foundations of my vacation ( The stay, the beach, etc.). Oceanside is a beautiful place that I would recommend to any beach lovers and explorers and/or adventurers. It is a remarkable place. It holds many memories in my heart.
